 				<h3>FISH</h3>
 				<hr>
 				<p>In the aquarium hobby, there are thousands of different fish you can choose from. The only problem is, some fish are not compatible to put in with other fish because they are either aggressive or live in different water parameters. Before you buy a fish, make sure to do your research on the species. Not all fish can just be put together in one place like in Noah's ark. Many fish are also very sensitive to water and may catch a disease or die if you put them in a different environment. Beginners should start with fish (not goldfish) that can withstand many different bad situations that could be presented to them, these fish are listed above. Having healthy fish that can move freely around your aquarium has been proven to improve the mental health of people.</p>

 				<h3>PLANTS</h3>
 				<hr>
 				<p>Live plants can guve your aquarium a more natural and greener look, and can even supply your fish' oxygen. Plants are a staple to hobbyists that want a better, fuller tank, instead of an empty one. Plantkeeping does come with a price specially because some need a strong light, good substrate, good fertilizer, or maybe a CO2 diffuser system. Some plants can survive with minimal light and nutrients like the hornwort, these are good beginner plants because they don't need much attention and won't cost much money in maintenance. Some aquatic plants though, need very good care because they can also be sensitive to water parameters, the amount of CO2 diffused in the water and the nutrients found in the substrate. These plants should only be kept by experienced and dedicated hobbyists because they need to always be cared for.</p>
