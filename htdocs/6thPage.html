 				<div id="info"> <h3>Plecos</h3><hr><p>Pleco are not a beginner fish but can be a great algae eater and ornamental fish if you add it to your aquarium. There are many types of pleco with different sizes, colors and patterns. When keeping pleco in aquariums, you should always stay away from common plecos that can grow very big and turn to smaller ones like xebra plecos or bristlenose plecos. The only downside of the smaller, rarer plecos is that they are more expensive.</p>

 				<div id="info2"> <h3>Tetras</h3><hr><p>Tetras are a great beginner fish because they can also withstand harsher environments. Tetras should always be kapt in schools with atleast 6 individuals so that they will not attack other fish and are generally happier in schools. Tetras like large planted aquariums with water flow, they are fast moving and are a great colorful addition to large, planted community tanks.</p>

 				<div id="info3"> <h3>Barbs</h3><hr><p>Barbs are like tetras but on steroids. They are larger and more aggressive if compared to tetras but they also have the same schooling behavior. Keeping them in schools of atleast 6 individuals drastically decreases their aggressiveness. Barbs should not be put in aquariums with long finned fish because they will eat their fins. Barbs are very fast and also like large, planted community tanks.</p>

 				<div id="info4"> <h3>Danios</h3><hr><p>Danios are a great beginner fish because they are very abundant
 									Danios are also quite hardy but are not as hardy as Guppies.
 									Danios come in many colors and varieties some may be cheap
 									but some are very expensive.</p>

 				<div id="info5"> <h3>Koi</h3><hr><p>Koi are not a beginner fish but they are a great addition to ponds for experienced fish keepers. Koi have a longer lifespan compared to humans and if cared for well can outlive its original owner. They can also grow to massive sizes if cared for and are often seen in fish auctions. There are many koi patterns and varieties most of them are centered in Japan.</p>

 				<div id="info6"> <h3>Arowanas</h3><hr><p>Arowanas are monster fish that should not be handled by beginner fish keepers. Arowanas need a lot of maintenance and attention and they also cost a lot. They like large bare aquariums with a lot of swimming space, there should also be a strong lid because arowanas like jumping out of the water. Arowanas can be fed with live fish and insects because this is what they usually eat in the wild. There are many varieties of arowana and I will only recommend them to the very experienced monster fish keeper.</p>
