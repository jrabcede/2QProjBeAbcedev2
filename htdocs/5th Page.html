				<ol>
					<li>Goldfish should be keot in waters with a pH level of around 7-8.5.</li><br>
					<li>Goldfish should be kept in large tanks with lots of water and no substrate, they also need oxygen in the water, like most fish, to survive.</li><br>

					<li>You should only feed goldfish the minimal food that they require because they can get bloated easily.</li><br>

 				<h3>GOLDFISH</h3>
 				<hr>
 				<p>Goldfish are also often seen in fish shows because of their varieties, sizes, humps and colors. Goldfish like larger tanks and clear but healthy water and are not suited for decorated aquariums. Many enthusiasts breed them and groom them for show. They groom the goldfish to enlargen their humps and to brighten their colors as well as enlarging their bodies. Many fish keepers often veer away from keeping goldfish because of their destructive tendencies and their incompatibility with other fish. Many goldfish breeds are subject to controversy because of their enlarged bubble eyes and cheeks.</p>
