				<h3>Betta Keeping Tips</h3>
				<hr>
				<ol>
					<li>Bettas do best in environments that have a pH range of 6.5-7.5.</li><br>
					<li>Bettas like hiding spots like leaves, rocks and vegetation but many keepers tend to keep bettas in tanks with minimal decorations as to not damage their fins.</li><br>
					<li>Bettas are insectivores in the wild, meaning that they like to be fed small feeder insects, as well as worms.</li><br>
					<li>You can keep bettas without oxygen in the water because they can breath air but they will still prefer breathing through their gills underwater.</li><br>
					<li>Male bettas are best kept alone in a medium-sized aquarium.</li><br>

 				<h3>BETTAS</h3>
 				<hr>
 				<p>Bettas are beautiful fish that are often seen in fish shows(pageants) and sometimes in betta fighting tournaments(now frowned upon). They have different varieties that have different colors, fin forms and patterns. The price of a betta can vary between around 20 pesos to a few thousand, this depends on the quality, breeder and whether it is a champion family line. Betta enthusiats use many techniques to enhance the color and the form of their Bettas, the most common of which is flare training. Flare training is when 2 bettas can see each other but are separated by a barrier, this prompts them to extend their fins and show more vibrant colors which are the categories that are judged in betta shows.</p>
