 				<h3>GUPPIES</h3>
 				<hr>
 				<p>Guppies are probably the most well known and abundant starter fish. Guppies can withstand harsh aquarium conditions and still reproduce like crazy, a community of about a few hundred guppies will have hundreds of babies every week. Guppies are also usually seen in fish shows because of their colors, fins and patterns. There are hundreds of guppy strains around the world, each with their own unique pattern and are classified into groups according to their color, pattern and fin forms. Breeders have selectively bred guppies for new patterns and fin shapes for decades, the reason why some guppies are getting less hardy is because of excessive inbreeding to stabilize a pattern.</p>
